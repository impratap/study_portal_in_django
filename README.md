# overview
## Project:
It is an E-Study Portal Project. This is one of the best projects I have learned and built. In this project, I have created a lot of features that can help students in their path of learning. It has eight different-different features like Notes, Todos, Homework, youtube, Books, Dictionary, Wikipedia. And this project also has user authentication and authorization so that only the specific user can use their account and details.

## Aim

This project aims to create an E-Study Portal for the student for their help. This project can help students in many ways like they can keep a record of their homework search for particular books and videos, and they can also use Wikipedia through this project. This project also has Dictionary so that students can search for the meaning of any words.
